                <img src="assets/images/Amrit_headshotV2-250x300.jpeg" alt="Picture not loading"> I was born in New Delhi India, on March 11, 1989. I moved to Canada when I was 7 and was raised in Brampton
                Ontario. I completed my undergraduate studies at McMaster University and obtained a Bachelor's in Science
                (Honours) in Biology and Mathematics.

                I was unsure as to what to do next and moved out west to Vancouver, BC, and ended up going to graduate school at the University
                of British Columbia. I obtained a PhD in Experimental Medicine under the supervison of Dr. Scott Tebbutt.

                Currently, I am researcher at the University of British Columbia, studying asthma and heart failure. I am interested in identifying
                molecular biomarkers of different disease phenotypes. I am also interested in developing algorithms to integration
                multiple omics datasets obtained on the same set of individuals. Lastly, I am interesting in developing web
                applications that aid in the interpretation/visualizations of complex statistical models.
